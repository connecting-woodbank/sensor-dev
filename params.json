It is comprised of a network of sensor nodes based around an Arduino board conected to a series of sensors and a short range radio.\r\n\r\n\r\nSensors\r\n=======\r\nThe sensor nodes each contain sensors for measuring:\r\n- soil temperature\r\n- soil relative moisture\r\n- air temperatue\r\n- air relative humidity\r\n- light level (Red, Green and Blue wavelengths)\r\n- infra-red radiation\r\n",
