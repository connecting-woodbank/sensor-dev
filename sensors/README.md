README
======
The Connecting Woodbank project aims to create a wireless sensor network for monitoring growing conditions to reduce inefficiencies within small-scale agriculture.  It is comprised of a network of sensor nodes based around an Arduino board conected to a series of sensors and a short range radio.


Sensors
=======
The sensor nodes each contain sensors for measuring:
- soil temperature
- soil relative moisture
- air temperatue
- air relative humidity
- light level (Red, Green and Blue wavelengths)
- infra-red radiation
