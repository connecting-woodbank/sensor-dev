Notes on linux arduino development

Libraries
On linux the arduino libraries are located at: home/USERNAME/sketchbook/libraries/
Each library is then placed within a seperate folder.  Librares used inthis project copied here from the "libraries" folder.
To use these "machine" c.f. "project" libraries, the libraries are included within <> brackets rather than qutations marks.

Serial ports
Ports can e found on linux using the command:
$ dmesg | grep tty
This lists the serial ports available.

Serial monitors
As on all systems, there are several serial monitors available for linux.  
The one that I use here is the "screen" utility.
To connect to this run the command:
screen <serial_port> <baud_rate>
e.g.
screen /dev/ttyUSB1 9600

To close the session, close the window by using the command
Ctrl-a \ (thats hold down Ctrl key, whilst pressing "a", release both then press "\".  A y/n dialog then appears.

	Alternative serial monitors
cu
To open a serial port e.g. USB1 at 9600 baud rate:
cu -l /dev/ttyUSB1 -s 9600
To exit use tilde dot (~.).
NOTE: cannot get to quit

	minicom
This needs setting up beforehand to use the correct port/baud rate
TO setup open minicom as root with the configure optin
sudo minicom -s

From the the default baud rate and serial port can be conifugred and saved.
Then minicom can be run simply by typing minicom from the termainla window
To exit Ctrl-A x

Gtkterm 
- gui but can't get it to open a port successfully.
