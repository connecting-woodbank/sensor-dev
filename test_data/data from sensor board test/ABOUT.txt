Data format for bitscope files

- from DSO (??) application: [DSO guide](http://www.bitscope.com/software/dso/guide/2.5/?p=recorder)

trigger	stamp	channel	index	type	delay	factor	rate	count	data

- trigger: number identifying the tigger event
- stamp: timestamp identifying the time (of day) of the trigger
- channel: channel number (1-11)
- index: index identifying all records belonging to the same frame (seems to be the same within the same trigger event for channels 4-11 but different for 0,1)
- type: capture data type - encoded as digit e.g. 0
- delay: post-trigger delay applied (if any)
- factor: decimation/oversample factor applied (if any)
- rate: sample rate at which data was captured (Hz??)
- count: number of samples captured in the  record (total time is count/rate)
- data: data is formatted in rows per channel per trigger followed by entries from next trigger

DATA PROCESSING

- The easiest way to process the data is to manually select one specific trigger from the data e.g. in excel and then copy/paste transpose to another sheet.  The channels not used can then be imported using Matlab scripts.  An example data formate is shown.
